# JavaScript-Projects
Will be adding all projects I created using JS under this repository

# 1. To Do List
- Basic to do list that remembers what a user adds by saving it to local storage
- Can be customised by allowing the user to add their name and new categories so 
that they can group certain tasks 

# 2. JS RPG
- Followed a tutorial by freeCodeCamp.org and coded a simple game using HTML, CSS & JS
- Applied a lot of concepts from JS and managed to code the game successfully

# 3. Frontend Movie Search App
- Created a frontend movie search app 
- Used APIs to produce search results
- Created a backend reviews API - used Node.js & MongoDB
- Connected both the frontend and backend together
